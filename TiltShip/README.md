# TiltShip

This is an Android game that aims to recreate the Asteroid game experience for a more modern audience. 

## About

Language: C#.

This game lets you control a ship by using Android's accelerometer to measure the tilt of the user's phone and move the ship in that direction. To shoot and destroy the asteroids the user needs to click them on the screen at which point the gun will auto-target the selected asteroid and shoot until it is destroyed or a new target is selected.
Destroying asteroids can make them drop upgrades and powerups as well as making more difficult asteroids spawn.

## Running
