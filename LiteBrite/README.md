# LiteBrite

This is an application designed to mimic the functionality of a Lite-Brite toy by letting users make mosiac like pictures using tiles of various colors, sizes and shapes.

## About

Language: C#.

This program uses WPF to create an interface that allows users to place "tiles" of various colors, shapes and sizes onto a custom sized board. The interface supports "drag and drop" functionality letting users drag desired tiles and drop them onto the board. There are different modes of moving the tiles, "move", "copy", and "swap" as well as letting users drag tiles from the board back onto tile picker which will copy that tile's settings. The board can then be turned "on" and "off" which simulates it being lit up. Designs can also be saved and loaded by the interface.

## Running
